Dear Professor Balakrishnan,

I'm writing to you about your awesome position at BU.
I'm PhD student at Dartmouth College, under the guidance of the glorious JV.
I would like to reiterate the interest in working with you expressed in my recent application.
Your work in blah and blah is very appealing to me, and it fits within my research interests.
I feel we could work productively together and write great papers

Sincerely,
