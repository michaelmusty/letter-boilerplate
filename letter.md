Dear Professor Balakrishnan,

I am writing to you about the Simons post-doctoral position
you have available at Boston University.
I am a PhD student at Dartmouth College
working under the supervision of John Voight.
I have been working in the area of computational number theory and arithmetic
geometry since 2012
(coinciding with my first interactions
with John Voight at the University of Vermont).
My interests and skills align nicely with the Simons collaboration
and this position.

Programming has been a large part of my research,
and a strong programming background is what I bring to the table for
this position.
Over the years I have used a wide range of languages and
programming techniques to tackle difficult problems in
arithmetic geometry and have become a proficient coder.
I have experience working on large-scale team projects
and executing my tasks in the context of the team effort.
Large team projects related to the LMFDB and effective Falting's theorem
need trusted individuals to delegate work to.
I enjoy taking on challenging (or even annoying!)
mathematical programming problems and making them happen
with readable elegant code.

I am excited at the prospect of helping to push forward your
successful work on studying rational points and being an asset
you can count on in your research group.
I am a huge fan of the efforts of the Simons collaboration,
and I look forward to the future of the collaboration
regardless of my involvement.

Thank you for your consideration,
